# Freeki Wiki Server

Freeki is a lightweight wiki system built around Vert.x, Markdown for formatting, Git for storage/history, Groovy for templating, and Javascript+jQuery for skinning. It's designed to support distributed content editing, a read-only view mode, and almost total customization on a per-wiki basis.
